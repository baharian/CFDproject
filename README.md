## Source code for a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation

### General info
This is the source code, written in C and parallelized with OpenMP, of a CFD project I did in graduate school to simulate atmospheric phenomena. A video of the simulation can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxOC1jKVio-1bmMzSnZKRWtqYms/view?usp=sharing).
